abstract = "Contemporary AI shows a healthy trend away from artificial problems towards real-world applications. Less healthy, however, is the fashionable disparagement of “toy” domains: when properly approached, these domains can at the very least support meaningful systematic experiments, and allow features relevant to many kinds of reasoning to be abstracted and studied. A major reason why they have fallen into disrepute is that superficial understanding of them has resulted in poor experimental methodology and consequent failure to extract useful information. This paper presents a sustained investigation of one such toy: the (in)famous Blocks World planning problem, and provides the level of understanding required for its effective use as a benchmark. Our results include methods for generating random problems for systematic experimentation, the best domain-specific planning algorithms against which AI planners can be compared, and observations establishing the average plan quality of near-optimal methods. We also study the distribution of hard/easy instances, and identify the structure that AI planners must be able to exploit in order to approach Blocks World successfully."
