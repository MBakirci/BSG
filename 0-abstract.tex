Real-time strategy games have been proven to be a perfect environment in which to study artificial intelligence techniques. This lead to a large increase of research being done on different topics within the scope of real-time strategy games, which makes it very difficult to have a general overview of all the progress made. This paper summarizes the most notable and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques that have been applied to specific areas of real-time strategy games in the past couple of years.
